# How Bay Area fog dissipated over 70 years with climate change
## Story Summary 
Karl the Fog, a beloved meteorological personality, shrouds the Bay Area in a cool and mystical embrace. Driven by the Pacific's chilly currents, this iconic fog blankets San Francisco's landscape, influencing the region's climate and culture. Enigmatic and elusive, Karl is both admired and playfully challenged by locals and visitors alike as it weaves an ever-changing tapestry of mist and wonder across the iconic Golden Gate Bridge and city skyline.

However, the iconic fog of the Bay Area has exhibited a noticeable decline over recent years, as documented by NOAA data. This decline is attributed to the complex interplay of climate change, impacting the region's temperature and atmospheric dynamics. Rising temperatures and altered wind patterns disrupt the traditional fog formation processes, leading to reduced fog occurrences. This shift highlights the profound influence of climate change on local ecosystems and weather patterns, underscoring the urgent need for sustainable practices to mitigate its effects and preserve the unique characteristics of the Bay Area's climate.

I compared the change in summer temperatures in the Bay Area from 1948 to 2023, and compared it to the average temperature for the entire state of California over the same time period with the average temperature for the United States. It was found that while the Bay Area is significantly cooler than the rest of the country and the nation as a whole, the region's temperature is increasing at a greater rate than the rest of the country. At the same time, I integrated the data from 1948 to 2023 from the Bay Area's fog monitoring stations and found that the number of annual fog days has dropped dramatically.

My research on related scientific studies shows that, the dissipation of fog in the Bay Area over 70 years can be attributed to a combination of natural and anthropogenic factors. Changes in regional climate patterns, including shifts in ocean temperatures and atmospheric circulation, have influenced fog formation and dispersal. Additionally, urbanization and industrial activities may have altered local microclimates through heat and pollution emissions. These factors collectively impact fog frequency and intensity. 

## Sourcing
I researched [weather data from two of NOAA's Bay Area stations](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/access/monitoring/monthly-report/), which is one in Richmond, another in Half Moon Bay. Richmond is situated in the western part of California's United States, positioned along the eastern shores of the San Francisco Bay. Half Moon Bay is located on the Pacific coast of California, south of San Francisco and San Mateo, nestled between the rugged coastline and the Santa Cruz Mountains.[searching tool of temperature in different areas](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/access/search/dataset-search?text=)
