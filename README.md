# How Bay Area fog dissipated over 70 years with climate change
## Story Summary 
Karl the Fog, a beloved meteorological personality, shrouds the Bay Area in a cool and mystical embrace. Driven by the Pacific's chilly currents, this iconic fog blankets San Francisco's landscape, influencing the region's climate and culture. Enigmatic and elusive, Karl is both admired and playfully challenged by locals and visitors alike as it weaves an ever-changing tapestry of mist and wonder across the iconic Golden Gate Bridge and city skyline.

However, the iconic fog of the Bay Area has exhibited a noticeable decline over recent years, as documented by NOAA data. This decline is attributed to the complex interplay of climate change, impacting the region's temperature and atmospheric dynamics. Rising temperatures and altered wind patterns disrupt the traditional fog formation processes, leading to reduced fog occurrences. This shift highlights the profound influence of climate change on local ecosystems and weather patterns, underscoring the urgent need for sustainable practices to mitigate its effects and preserve the unique characteristics of the Bay Area's climate.

I compared the change in summer temperatures in the Bay Area from 1948 to 2023, and compared it to the average temperature for the entire state of California over the same time period with the average temperature for the United States. It was found that while the Bay Area is significantly cooler than the rest of the country and the nation as a whole, the region's temperature is increasing at a greater rate than the rest of the country. At the same time, I integrated the data from 1948 to 2023 from the Bay Area's fog monitoring stations and found that the number of annual fog days has dropped dramatically.

My research on related scientific studies shows that, the dissipation of fog in the Bay Area over 70 years can be attributed to a combination of natural and anthropogenic factors. Changes in regional climate patterns, including shifts in ocean temperatures and atmospheric circulation, have influenced fog formation and dispersal. Additionally, urbanization and industrial activities may have altered local microclimates through heat and pollution emissions. These factors collectively impact fog frequency and intensity. 

## Sourcing
I researched [weather data from two of NOAA's Bay Area stations](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/access/monitoring/monthly-report/), which is one in Richmond, another in Half Moon Bay. Richmond is situated in the western part of California's United States, positioned along the eastern shores of the San Francisco Bay. Half Moon Bay is located on the Pacific coast of California, south of San Francisco and San Mateo, nestled between the rugged coastline and the Santa Cruz Mountains.
Here is where i got data about temperature in summer in Bay area, and i requested the temperature of California and the whole states too, to dig more information behind.

### Research
Here are report and articles about climate change impacts on Bay Area fog, and local ecology.
  * [Any truth to the rumors that San Francisco is losing its fog?](https://www.sfgate.com/local/article/karl-the-fog-17752046.php)

The Bay Area experiences summer fog due to cold water along the California coast. Cold water from the California Current and upwelling cools the air, causing moisture to condense into fog. Winds and the Earth's rotation create upwelling, bringing nutrient-rich cold water to the surface. This process supports marine life and kelp forests. Fog forms as warm land air rises, drawing in the foggy ocean air. However, fog has decreased by 33% in 60 years due to weakening upwelling caused by global warming. Warmer surface layers hinder mixing with cold water, reducing fog production. This decline, impacting San Francisco's iconic fog, is attributed to climate change
  * [Clearing and Present Danger? Fog That Nourishes California Redwoods Is Declining](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/fog-that-nourishes-california-redwoods-declining/)

The towering California redwoods, Earth's tallest trees, rely on coastal fog for their growth, but new research suggests this fog is diminishing. Climatologist James Johnstone and biologist Todd Dawson from UC Berkeley studied data from weather stations and airports along the northern California coast, where these massive trees thrive. Airport ceiling height measurements revealed a 30% decrease in fog over six decades. Redwoods, concentrated along California's northern coast, utilize fog in summer to capture moisture through specialized leaves, aiding growth in the dry season. Fog covers leaves and enters pores, moving water to roots—a unique process among trees. This fog loss poses concerns for redwood forests.
  * [The Deep, Cold Secret Behind Summer Fog](https://www.kqed.org/quest/22340/the-deep-cold-secret-behind-summer-fog)

This article explores the phenomenon of summer fog in the Bay Area, focusing on the Pacific Ocean's role. Cold water off the Northern California coast leads to fog formation as it cools the air above. The region's cold waters result from the California Current and upwelling, where deep ocean water surfaces due to coastal winds and Earth's rotation. Nutrient-rich upwelling sustains marine life and kelp forests. Fog forms as this cold air meets warmer land, condensing moisture. However, fog has decreased 33% in 60 years, partly due to weakened upwelling from global warming. Warmer surface layers hinder upwelling, reducing fog production and altering the iconic San Francisco summer fog.

Throughout, the summer weather in the Bay Area is cooler compared to California as a whole and the US as a whole due to the fog, but the Bay Area's temperature rises faster than California as a whole and the US as a whole.

### 3)Story behind data

Fog as "ocean air conditioning" that brings both cooling and moisture to the Bay Area during the hottest and driest part of the year.
According to science research, the fog's benefits extend widely. Agricultural regions like the Salinas Valley, where fog reaches 75 km inland, safeguard crops like lettuce and strawberries from sun damage. Wine regions, Sonoma and Napa, also gain as fog navigates through San Francisco Bay and the Petaluma Gap. Coastal-restricted species, such as coast redwoods, thrive, receiving up to a third of their water from fog. The realization that plants in foggy forests can absorb water through their leaves transformed our view of fog's ecological role. 

For low-flow coastal streams, fog drip rescues salmonids from drying out in the Mediterranean dry season.The more coastal nature reserves in the North Bay, the more vulnerable they are to climate change, according to scientists' estimates.

We can see a climatic change in the fog, and it's impact on local environment.
